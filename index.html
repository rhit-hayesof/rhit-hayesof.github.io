            I am a Sophmore Computer Science Major at Rose-Hulman with an interest in software development computer engineering applications. I have experience in Python, Java, C, Assembly, Verilog and many other programming languages. I grew up with computers as my dad worked in IT and I had access to one since I was just 5 years old. I spent alot of time on the internet and tinkering with various applications online and thought that maybe it was something I wanted to do in the future, well here we are.

            I am the oldest of three siblings and I was born in New Jersey but my family and I moved to the Island of St.Thomas in 2013. St.Thomas is located in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) and it is where I have spent most of my life. Growing up in two very different environements was disorienting at first but as I grew older I grew to appreciate the unique benefits both the city and the island had to offer. My favorite hobbies include wood-burning art, fishing, and video games.
